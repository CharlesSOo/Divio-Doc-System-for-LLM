    "Tutorials should be beginner-friendly with step-by-step instructions that always work",
    "How-to guides solve specific problems for users with some experience",
    "Reference documentation should be comprehensive, accurate, and structured around code organization",

    "Test tutorials with complete beginners to ensure they work reliably",
