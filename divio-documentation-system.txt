# Divio Documentation System (Diátaxis) - Complete Framework Guide

## Overview

The Divio Documentation System, now known as Diátaxis (from Ancient Greek δῐᾰ́τᾰξῐς: dia "across" + taxis "arrangement"), is a systematic approach to technical documentation developed by Daniele Procida. It identifies four distinct types of documentation, each serving different user needs and contexts.

**Core Principle:** "There isn't one thing called documentation, there are four."

## The Four Quadrants

The system recognizes four documentation types arranged in a matrix:

```
         Learning-oriented    |    Goal-oriented
    +-----------------------+------------------------+
    |      TUTORIALS        |     HOW-TO GUIDES     |
    |   (Learning by doing) |  (Solving problems)   |
    +-----------------------+------------------------+
    |     EXPLANATION       |      REFERENCE        |
    |  (Understanding why)  | (Information lookup)  |
    +-----------------------+------------------------+
       Understanding-oriented  |  Information-oriented
```

## 1. TUTORIALS - Learning-Oriented Documentation

### Purpose
- Take complete beginners by the hand through a series of steps
- Transform learners into users who can understand other documentation
- Build confidence and familiarity with the system

### Key Characteristics
- **Learning by doing**: Practical, hands-on experience
- **Beginner-focused**: Assume no prior knowledge
- **Step-by-step**: Clear, sequential instructions
- **Meaningful outcome**: Produce something concrete and useful
- **Robust and reliable**: Must work every time

### Best Practices
```
✅ DO:
- Allow users to learn by doing
- Get users started quickly
- Make sure tutorials work reliably
- Ensure outcomes are meaningful
- Show concrete results immediately
- Keep explanations minimal and necessary
- Guide every action explicitly

❌ DON'T:
- Explain concepts in depth
- Provide alternative approaches
- Skip steps or assume knowledge
- Focus on completeness over learning
- Include complex troubleshooting
```

### Example Structure
```
Tutorial: Building Your First Django Web Application

1. Set up your development environment
   - Install Python 3.x
   - Install Django using pip

2. Create a new project
   - Run: django-admin startproject mysite
   - Navigate to project directory

3. Create your first view
   - Edit views.py
   - Add URL configuration

4. Run the development server
   - Execute: python manage.py runserver
   - View result in browser

Result: Working web application displaying "Hello, World!"
```

## 2. HOW-TO GUIDES - Goal-Oriented Documentation

### Purpose
- Solve specific real-world problems
- Provide recipes for achieving particular goals
- Address questions from experienced users

### Key Characteristics
- **Problem-solving**: Answer "How do I...?" questions
- **Assume experience**: Reader has some background knowledge
- **Flexible**: Allow for different approaches
- **Practical**: Focus on getting things done
- **Specific**: Address particular use cases

### Best Practices
```
✅ DO:
- Provide clear series of steps
- Focus on practical results

- Use descriptive titles
- Make steps adaptable
- Assume reasonable starting knowledge

❌ DON'T:
- Explain basic concepts
- Start from absolute basics
- Provide comprehensive theory
- Include every possible variation
- Focus on understanding over doing
```

### Example Structure
```

- Focus on problem-solving
- Add extensive commentary
```

### Example Structure
```
Reference: Django Model Fields

CharField

```

## 4. EXPLANATION - Understanding-Oriented Documentation

### Purpose
- Clarify and illuminate topics
- Provide context and background
- Explore the "why" behind design decisions

### Key Characteristics
- **Context-providing**: Background information and reasoning
- **Discursive**: Broad discussion of topics
- **Multiple perspectives**: Consider alternatives and trade-offs
- **Understanding-focused**: Deepen comprehension
- **Leisurely reading**: Can be consumed at reader's pace

### Best Practices
```
✅ DO:
- Provide historical context
- Explain design decisions
- Discuss alternatives
- Explore implications
- Connect to broader concepts
- Take a wider view
- Make connections between ideas

❌ DON'T:
- Provide step-by-step instructions
- Include detailed technical reference
- Focus on immediate tasks
- Duplicate tutorial content
```

### Example Structure
```
Explanation: Why Django Uses the MVC Pattern

Background
----------
Django implements the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, 
though it refers to it as Model-View-Template (MVT). This design decision 
stems from the need to separate concerns in web applications.

Historical Context
-----------------
The MVC pattern emerged in the 1970s as a way to organize complex user 
interfaces. Web frameworks adopted this pattern to manage the complexity 
of handling HTTP requests, database operations, and HTML generation.

Django's Interpretation
----------------------
Django's MVT pattern differs from traditional MVC:
- Models handle data and business logic
- Views process requests and return responses
- Templates handle presentation logic

This separation provides several benefits:
- Easier maintenance and testing
- Clear separation of concerns
- Reusable components
- Better collaboration between developers

Alternative Approaches
---------------------
Other frameworks implement different patterns:
- Flask uses a more minimal approach
- FastAPI focuses on API-first development
- Express.js provides middleware-based architecture

Each approach has trade-offs in complexity, flexibility, and learning curve.
```

## Implementation Framework

### Getting Started with Diátaxis

1. **Audit Existing Documentation**
   - Categorize current content into the four quadrants
   - Identify gaps and overlaps
   - Plan content reorganization

2. **Content Planning Matrix**
```

-------------------|----------------|------------------
Learning           | Tutorials      | How-to Guides
Information Lookup | Explanation    | Reference
```

3. **Writing Guidelines by Type**

**Tutorials:**
- Start with installation/setup
- Build something meaningful
- Test thoroughly with beginners
- Update regularly

**How-to Guides:**
- Begin with problem statement
- Provide clear prerequisites
- Focus on solution steps
- Link to reference docs

**Reference:**
- Mirror code structure

## Conclusion

The Divio Documentation System (Diátaxis) provides a proven framework for creating comprehensive, user-focused documentation. By recognizing the four distinct types of documentation needs—learning, goal-oriented problem-solving, information lookup, and understanding—teams can create more effective and maintainable documentation systems.

The key to successful implementation is maintaining strict separation between the quadrants while ensuring appropriate cross-links and clear navigation paths for users moving between different documentation needs.
